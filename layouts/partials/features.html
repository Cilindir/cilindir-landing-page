                    Adaptive AI characters serve as personal, highly knowledgeable mentors, experts, and guides. Users
                    can see, hear, and interact with these AI systems as if they were another person together in the
                    same room. AI educators are trained on vast amounts of information, and designed with strict safety
                    protocols.

                    The Rift is built on <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal
                        Engine</a>, a leading game development engine known for its stunning
                    graphics and advanced physics. This makes it possible for learners to explore dynamic virtual worlds
                    where AI characters can move naturally and interact with their surroundings.

                    The Cilindir Rift provides a fully wearables-free experience&mdash;no VR headset required. This
                    eliminates discomfort and fatigue associated with the prolonged use of headsets and hand
                    controllers, reduces hygiene concerns, and avoids barriers for both younger and older
                    learners.

                    Integrated cameras track the users' position and facial expression in real time, enabling more
                    natural AI interactions. This tracking data allows AI characters to maintain natural eye contact
                    and better understand the learner's age and level of comprehension. No video data is recorded or
                    stored.

                    This optional feature allows the Rift to render content based on the userâ€™s position and viewing
                    angle. Like looking into a mirror, the view changes naturally as you move your head. This makes the
                    projected image appear spatially consistent and realistic, unlike a traditional flat-screen display.
