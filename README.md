# Cilindir landing page

This project contains the source code for Cilindir's landing page.

## 🚀 Getting started

This site is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/). To get started, install Hugo, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
hugo server
```

This will start a local development server and monitor for changes, allowing you to preview updates to the landing page in real time.

## 🌐 Hosting

Our landing page is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). Any new changes are automatically published whenever updates are merged into the `main` branch.


## 🖼️ Hero section renders

This section contains render image size details for the hero section’s tri-scene panels.

Single tri-scene image (desktop): `4150 x 1440`

2-panel scene (mobile): `1300 x 1440`

1-panel scene (mobile): `900 x 1440`

To avoid bloating the project, all renders are resized to a height of `500` pixels. For example, the tri-scene images for desktop are resized to `1440 × 500`.
