      imageAlt: "Conservation through Story"
      description: "Go beyond static signs with immersive storytelling. Users can watch how climate change impacts coral reefs, experience the migration paths of endangered sea turtles, or see the effects of deforestation on orangutan habitats. With visually stunning graphics and realistic physics, it feels as if you were really there."

      imageAlt: "Interactive AI Wildlife"
      description: "Visitors can engage directly with AI animals, observing their behaviors and interacting with them up close in a mutually safe virtual environment. Optionally, animals can communicate, sharing insights about their species and ecosystems, fostering empathy and a deeper understanding of wildlife. AI wildlife can appear as stylized cartoon characters in a computationally realistic simulation."
